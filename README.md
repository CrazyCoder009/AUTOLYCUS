# Precautions and Limitations:

1. Downloading using the same account everyday would lead to a temporary ban of 24hrs from Google Collab, so try using different accounts everyday (your gmail or srmist alternatively).  

2. Changing the runtime type may give you more or less downloading memory depending on which you select, hence best to leave the runtime configurations to default if you're a noob.(107 GB Limit of download at once, plenty bruh!).
